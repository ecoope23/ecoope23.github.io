          <h3>Liz Cooper
            <small>Asst. Professor & Principal Investigator</small>
          </h3>
          <p>Dr. Cooper joined the Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics at UNC Charlotte in 2018. She received her Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the University of Southern California in 2011, then worked as a post-doc at the University of Miami from 2011 to 2014. She subsequently became a research associate at Clemson University, which is where she became interested in applying her background in evolutionary biology and genomics to agricultural systems.</p>

			<h3>Azita Alasvand Zarasvand
				<small>Ph.D. Assistant</small>
			</h3>
			<p>Azita Alasvand Zarasvand received her M.Sc in Plant Genomics from North Dakota State University in 2019. Her previous research experience was focused on transcriptomic studies of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> exposed to nanoparticles as an abiotic stress that induced physiological reprogramming of plant innate immunity in order to enhance and compromise resistance to microbial pathogens. After joining Dr. Cooper’s lab as a research assistant at UNC Charlotte in the fall of 2019, she started collaborating on various plant molecular biology experiments looking at processes that drive evolutionary adaptation and diversification in the cereal crop Sorghum.</p>

			<h3>William Voelker
				<small>Ph.D. Student</small>
			</h3>
			<p>William Voelker graduated from North Carolina State University with a B.S in Plant Biology in 2020. He is now working on earning his PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Under the guidance of Dr. Elizabeth Cooper, he is currently studying structural variant analysis and genome assembly methods in sorghum.</p>

				<small>Masters Student</small>
			</h3>
			<p>Krishna Thakor is a Bioinformatics graduate student at UNC Charlotte. She joined Dr. Cooper's lab in October 2020. She completed her undergraduate in Biology from the University of North Carolina Charlotte in 2020. She is currently working with Wyeomyia Smithii (Pitcher plant mosquito), where she is generating the reference genome and looking at the structure of the genome to see what might give this mosquito the ability to adapt to its unique habitat inside the pitcher plant.</p>

			<h3>Lindsay Shields
				<small>Certificate Student</small>
			</h3>
			<p>Lindsay Shields graduated from Appalachian State University in 2017 with a B.S in Molecular Biology and continued her education with a M.Sc at Clemson University as a USDA National Needs Fellow. Lindsay’s Master’s research focused on the genetic underpinnings of sorghum phytochemical properties such as root exudate induced microbiome recruitment and antimicrobial activity in sorghum grain. Immediately following her graduation, Lindsay joined Dr. Cooper’s lab in January 2021 where she is expanding into the computational field through investigating the demographic history of sorghum domestication.</p>
