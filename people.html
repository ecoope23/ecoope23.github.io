          <h3>Liz Cooper
            <small>Asst. Professor</small>
          </h3>
          <p>Dr. Cooper joined the Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics at UNC Charlotte in 2018. She received her Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the University of Southern California in 2011, then worked as a post-doc at the University of Miami from 2011 to 2014. She subsequently became a research associate at Clemson University, which is where she became interested in applying her background in evolutionary biology and genomics to agricultural systems.</p>

          <h3>Kittikun Songsomboon
            <small>Postdoc</small>
          </h3>
	  <p>Dr. Songsomboon is investigating structural variation and the impact of vacuolar iron transporters in sweet sorghum. Before joining the Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics at UNC Charlotte in 2018, he received his Ph.D. in Plant Breeding and Genetics from Cornell University earlier that same year. After gaining experience in conventional breeding and genome-wide association techniques with <i>Bipolaris</i> resistance in switchgrass, he is now broadening his skills in computational biology to better untangle complicated traits.</p>
